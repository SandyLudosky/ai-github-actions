It integrates seamlessly with GitHub Actions, enabling you to build smarter CI/CD pipelines, automate tedious tasks, or gain insights from your repository data.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Automated Actions:** Use AI models to automate tasks and optimize workflows.\n- **Data Insights:** Generate meaningful insights from repository data using pre-trained models.\n- **Ease of Integration:** Integrates directly into GitHub Actions, making it easy to implement in your CI/CD pipelines.\n\n## How to Use GitHub Models with GitHub Actions\n\nGitHub Models can be used alongside GitHub Actions to streamline workflows. To get started:\n\n1. **Enable the Feature:**\n   Ensure GitHub Models is enabled for your repository or organization from the repository settings or via API.\n\n2. **Configure GitHub Actions Workflow:**\n   Use a pre-defined action or write a custom action that integrates the model's outputs into your workflow.\n\n3. **Provide Necessary Inputs:**\n   Supply the required parameters to the model, such as repository data, commit history, or other metrics.\n\n4. **Review and Act:**\n   Validate the output provided by the model and decide on its application within your workflow.\n\nBelow is an example `workflow.yml` that harnesses GitHub Models:\n\n```yaml\nname: GitHub Models Workflow\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - main\n\njobs:\n  use-model:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout code\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n        \n      - name: Use GitHub Models\n        env:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n        run: |\n          curl -X POST -H \"Authorization: Bearer $GITHUB_TOKEN\" \\\n          -d '{\"input\": \"example data\"}' \\\n          https://api.github.com/models/predict\n```\n\n## Required Permissions\n\nTo use GitHub Models, you need to have the following permissions:\n\n1. **Repository Permissions:** Ensure proper read and write access for the repository as the models might fetch code or data.\n2. **GitHub Actions Secrets:** Store sensitive tokens, such as `GITHUB_TOKEN`, securely in the repository's secrets.\n\n### Permissions for API Calls\n\nYou need an **OAuth token** or **personal access token (PAT)** with these scopes:\n- `repo` (for private repository access).\n- `workflow` (to enable GitHub Actions).\n\n## Example cURL Request\n\nBelow is an example of how to make a request to the GitHub Models API using `cURL`:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST -H \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN\" \\\n     -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n     -d '{\n           \"input\": {\n             \"repository\": \"user/repo\",\n             \"branch\": \"main\",\n             \"task\": \"analyze-code\"\n           }\n         }' \\\n     https://api.github.com/models/predict\n```\n\nEnsure that you replace `YOUR_TOKEN` with a valid access token and provide appropriate input parameters.\n\n## Best Practices\n\nTo maximize the value of GitHub Models, follow these best practices:\n\n1. **Secure Tokens:** Store tokens in GitHub Secrets instead of hardcoding them.\n2. **Validate Output:** Review model outputs for errors or unusual recommendations before acting on them.\n3. **Use Logs:** Enable logging in your workflows to assess model behavior and debug issues effectively.\n4. **Keep Models Updated:** Regularly review model configurations and updates in your repository settings.\n5. **Test Integration Thoroughly:** Test workflows on development branches before deploying them to production branches.\n\n---\n\nGitHub Models are a powerful addition to any repository, helping you leverage machine learning to enhance productivity and streamline processes.
